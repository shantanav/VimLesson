The following cringe-fest has a number of spelling and grammar errors.
Go ahead and fix those. Or write a better story, I stole the cringiest
thing I could find from a free online 6th grade English as a second 
language textbook.


Yesterday, I gone to a party with my friend David. He study english with me at university. 
He wanted to be introduced to Lucy wo he fancied. David and I satt in the corner of the room. 
He didn ' t making the first move to go and see her. He waited for so long to tell her that he 
had a crush on her. He taked a drink to get some energy and after a few minutes of endless hesi-
tation, he walked to her. David remained mute. She gave a hint of a smile, noticing David blushing. 
She asked him if he enjoyed the party. He whispered ' Yes ' and had a glance at me. I wincked at 
him. That was it. Feeling reassured and confident, he told her which feelings he was experiencing. 
She suddenly looked sullen. She looked embarased. She could hardly say a word but after a little 
seconds, she said : ' I ' m sorry to deceive you but actually I fancy Sebastian ' . 

David fainted : ' a friend in need is a friend inded ' !
